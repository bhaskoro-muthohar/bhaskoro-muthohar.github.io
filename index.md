# Hello!

I am currently enrolling in Chemical Engineering as last year's Student. I am looking for an intern or co-op to boost my experiences and skills in Data Science.

I have been experienced using Matlab to complete my projects. Expert in operating Microsoft Office and good on using Excel macro and VBA.

I have a keen interest in data science, big data, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. My passion is coming up with strong analytical thinking and the way I loved coding so much.

You can download my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfdcwOIibfmybJnVAELs_Vm94t06-DY9/view?usp=sharing). My portfolio can be accessed on my GitHub or click [here](https://github.com/bhaskoro-muthohar/DataScienceLearning) for my Data Science learning projects. I also have badges from IBM at [youracclaim.com](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/bhaskoro-muthohar/badges)
