# Hello!

I currently enrolled in Chemical Engineering as last year Student. I am looking for intern or co-op to boost my experiences and skills in Data Scientist.

I have experience using Matlab to completed my projects. Expert in operating Microsoft Office and good on using Excel macro and VBA.

I have a strong interest in digital science, big data, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. My passion is coming up with strong analytical thinking and the way I loved coding so much.

You can download my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q2XnhOr-eVpGOseug-D6xfICZs5DTu7U/view?usp=sharing) and my portfolio can be accessed at my github or click [here](https://github.com/bhaskoro-muthohar/DataScienceLearning) for my Data Science learning projects.
