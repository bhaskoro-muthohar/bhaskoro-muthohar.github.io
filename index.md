# Hello!

I am a Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering from the University of Riau. I am looking for an intern or co-op to boost my experiences and skills in Data Science. In my journey to become a Data Scientist, I have been getting my hand's dirty practicing on data. It is proven with the projects I have done on GitHub, and I believe that becoming a Data Scientist means becoming lifelong learning. My passion is coming up with strong analytical thinking and the way I loved coding so much.

[My portfolio](https://github.com/bhaskoro-muthohar/DataScienceLearning) for Data Cases are:
1. Forecasting-Sales-Using-Prophet [Post](https://bhaskoro-muthohar.github.io//Forecasting-Sales-Using-Prophet/)
2. Analisa Data Pokemon berdasarkan Tipe Legendari dan Bukan Legendari. [Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analisa-data-pokemon-berdasarkan-tipe-legendari-dan-bukan-muthohar/)
3. Analyzing why people quit their job and who will quit next. Using Python and Machine Learning, Decision Tree Algorithm.[Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analyzing-why-people-quit-job-who-next-using-python-machine-muthohar/)
4. Mapping-Tempat-Populer-di-Pekanbaru [Github](https://github.com/bhaskoro-muthohar/Mapping-Tempat-Populer-di-Pekanbaru)
